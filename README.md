### 🫀 Heart Failure Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of heart failure based on patient health metrics. It’s designed to support early diagnosis and proactive healthcare decisions by analyzing medical data efficiently.

---

### 🚀 Features

* Predicts heart failure risk using logistic regression and other ML models
* Cleaned and preprocessed medical dataset for robust analysis
* Visualizations for data distribution and feature correlation
* Evaluation metrics (confusion matrix, accuracy, classification report)
* Jupyter Notebook interface for interactive exploration

### 🧠 System Design

This is a notebook-based data science project structured as follows:

```
                ┌────────────┐
                │ Dataset    │
                └────┬───────┘
                     │
              ┌──────▼──────┐
              │ Data Preprocessing │
              └──────┬──────┘
                     │
              ┌──────▼──────┐
              │ Model Training     │
              └──────┬──────┘
                     │
              ┌──────▼──────┐
              │ Model Evaluation   │
              └──────┬──────┘
                     │
              ┌──────▼──────┐
              │ Prediction & Visualization │
              └────────────┘
```

#### Key Components:

* **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans missing values, normalizes features, handles class balance.
* **Modeling**: Trains models like Logistic Regression, evaluates using multiple metrics.
* **Visualization**: Uses seaborn/matplotlib for plotting feature relationships and results.

### 🛠️ Setup Guide

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd heart-failure-prediction-ml
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Launch the notebook:**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
